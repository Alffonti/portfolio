# Portfolio

This project aims to showcase my design expertise to prospective clients, to establish a unique brand for myself as a designer and to reach audiences outside of my immediate professional circle.

## About The Project

The project feature three sections: What I do, Who I am and My Work. A 3x3 grid was used to display a selection of my works. The subtitles were positioned relative to its section to place the branding line behind the image. The BEM methodology was used for CSS selectors.
